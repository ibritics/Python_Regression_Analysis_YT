This tutorial will provide an introduction to regression analysis using Python. We will cover topics such as linear regression, coefficient of determination, multiple linear regression, ridge regression, polynomial models, correlation matrix, missing values and how to treat them? categorical variables and how to include them into model,  relationship between variables, logarithmic transformation for regression,an overfitting. We will see the distinction between supervised vs Unsupervised Learning and, Parametric and Unparametric model 
We will use libraries such as Scikit-Learn, statsmodels , NumPy, Matplotlib, and SciPy to explore and visualize data, and to build and evaluate regression models. We will also discuss how to calculate the R-squared value and the standard error of regression. Finally, we will look at how to use the statsmodels . By the end of this tutorial, you will have a better understanding of regression analysis and be able to apply it to your own data.
